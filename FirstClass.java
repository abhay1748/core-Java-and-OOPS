// java is oops
//every code start with a a class
// standard , file name and class name should be same is class is not public 
//if call is public then file name and class name must be same

class FirstClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
// static is a keyword
// java<filename>.java
// once it is compiled it generates a byte code and byte code is same as class
// name
